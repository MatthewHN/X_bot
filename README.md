This is an X (Twitter) automation post bot I coded from scratch to practice the use of Reddit and X's (Twitter) API.

The program fetches the top 3 hottest posts from a random subreddit of a list of previously choosen subreddits, processes the information, downloads the image and saves the caption (Reddit API). 
Then it posts on X (Twitter) with the downloaded image and the caption acordingly (X/Twitter API).

This program is made to run on a server so that it automatically executes itself once every 4 hours making sure it each time it at least posts once.
